# all-ruby

This software is a script to install historic Ruby versions since ruby-0.49.
Also, all-ruby script runs all ruby binaries with same arguments.

## Platform

This software is developed on Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) amd64.

However Ruby doesn't support 64 bit platform until ruby 1.8.0.
So, the older ruby needs 32 bit development tools which can be
installed as follows.

    % sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    % sudo apt update
    % sudo apt-get build-dep ruby2.5
    % sudo apt install rake gcc-multilib \
        zlib1g:i386 libncurses5:i386 libgdbm6:i386 libssl1.1:i386 \
        libreadline7:i386 libffi6:i386

For Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) :

    % sudo apt-get build-dep ruby2.3
    % sudo apt install rake gcc-multilib \
        zlib1g:i386 libncurses5:i386 libgdbm3:i386 libssl1.0.2:i386 \
        libreadline7:i386 libffi6:i386

## Usage

This software provides Rakefile and "rake all" downloads and builds
historic ruby versions.

    % git clone https://github.com/akr/all-ruby.git
    % cd all-ruby
    % rake setup_build
    % rake all  # this takes long time

Note that `rake setup_build` is same as
`mkdir ../build-all-ruby; ln -s ../build-all-ruby build`.
build-all-ruby directory is required to avoid that
`ruby -v` emits `last_commit=` line.

all-ruby script runs all ruby binaries.

    % ./all-ruby -e 'p RUBY_VERSION'
    ruby-0.49             -e:1: syntax error
		      exit 1
    ruby-0.50             -e:1: syntax error
		      exit 1
    ruby-0.51             -e:1: undefined method `p' for "main"(Object)
		      exit 1
    ruby-0.54             -e:1:in method `p': undefined method `p' for "main"(Object)
		      exit 1
    ruby-0.55             -e:1: undefined method `p' for "main"(Object)
		      exit 1
    ...
    ruby-0.65             -e:1: undefined method `p' for "main"(Object)
		      exit 1
    ruby-0.69             -e:1: Uninitialized constant RUBY_VERSION
		      exit 1
    ...
    ruby-1.3.4-990531     /tmp/rbHMsENn:1: uninitialized constant RUBY_VERSION (NameError)
		      exit 1
    ruby-1.3.4-990611     "1.3.4"
    ...
    ruby-2.7.0-preview1   "2.7.0"
    % ALL_RUBY_SINCE=ruby-1.6 all-ruby -e 'p 0.class'
    ruby-1.6.0            Fixnum
    ...
    ruby-2.3.8            Fixnum
    ruby-2.4.0-preview1   Integer
    ...
    ruby-2.7.0-preview1   Integer

## Documentation

rake without arguments shows the help message for the Rakefile.

    % rake
    "rake all" will install 384 ruby
    "rake list" shows versions
    "rake sync" updates versions

all-ruby without arguments shows help message for all-ruby script.

    % ./all-ruby
    usage: all-ruby RUBY-ARGS
    environment variables:
      ALL_RUBY_SINCE=ruby-1.4               run only versions since specified one
      ALL_RUBY_BINS='ruby-2.4.4 ruby-2.5.1' run only versions specfied
      ALL_RUBY_ADDBINS=./ruby               run specified commands additionaly
      ALL_RUBY_SHOW_DUP=yes                 don't suppress duplicated output

## Docker

Dockerfile is provided to generate a docker image containing
ruby binaries built by the Rakefile.

Pre-built docker image can be used as follows:

    % docker pull rubylang/all-ruby
    % docker run --rm rubylang/all-ruby ./all-ruby -v
    % docker run --rm -e 'ALL_RUBY_SINCE=ruby-2.0' \
        -e 'ALL_RUBY_ADDBINS=/usr/bin/ruby' \
        rubylang/all-ruby ./all-ruby -e 'p 0.class'

If you want to build a docker image yourself,
you can use following command.
This uses your CPUs parallel.

    % docker build ./ -t my-all-ruby

If you want to use only n CPUs, build argument j=n can be used.
(--cpuset-cpus option of "docker build" is also usable.)

    % docker build ./ --build-arg j=1 -t my-all-ruby
